# Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")

Thank you for your interest in this project. In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Project Maintainers must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file from each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project Maintainers and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

By submitting a Contribution, you are agreeing to the terms of this CLA. The primary method for agreeing to this CLA is by authorizing an automated CLA management tool (like CLA Assistant) connected to your Pull Requests.

### Agreement Details

**Please provide the following information when prompted by the CLA management tool.** Your full name will be kept private, while your GitHub username will be used as your public identifier.

*   **Full Name:** `_________________________` (Your legal name, kept private)
*   **GitHub Username:** `_________________________` (Your public identifier)

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to the Project.

**1. Definitions.**

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Project Maintainers.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Maintainers for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project Maintainers (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project Maintainers or their representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project Maintainers for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**2. Grant of Copyright License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**3. Grant of Patent License.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Project Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Project Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

**4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license.** If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Project Maintainers.

**5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.** You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

**6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,** except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

**7. You agree to notify the Project Maintainers of any facts or circumstances** of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
